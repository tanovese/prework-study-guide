# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide webpage is a resource for coding boot camp students. It was created for them to view content learned throughout the coding course. Coding students now have access to a webpage where they can view important information about what they have learned during the course. It was created using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Throughout creating this webpage I have learned how to structure a webpage, how to use HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and more.

In the DevTools console we can also see the topics of the webpage listed as well as a randomly selected topic chosen for us in case we don't know where to start.
