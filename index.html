        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements which define sections in a document that contain thematic content.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint.</li>

     <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li> A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Complete the following steps to save your work to GitHub: use the command git add -A to stage your changes. Next, use the command git commit -m "<your message here>" to commit your changes with a commit messages which describes the changes you made. Once the changes are added and committed locally, make sure the local branch is up to date before pushing up the changes. Pull in the base branch main to your feature branch by running the command git pull origin main. To complete the git flow, use git push to push your changes to the remote repository by using the following Git command, git push origin <feature/featurebranchname>.</li>

     <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into your code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true/truthy.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>The location of the data item in an array is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, and many other programming languages, arays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all of the items in an array by alowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: the first determines the starting point for our loop, the second is the condition, and the final statment is what allows the array to iterate over each time.</li>
          <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. Put /* before and */ after the block of code, to comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Unlike for loops and conditional statements, functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>1. Define the function. 2. Call the function.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword. A function name is followed by parentheses (). The code to be executed is written in curly brackets {}.</li>
