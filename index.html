        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements which define sections in a document that contain thematic content.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li> A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
